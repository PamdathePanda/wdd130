        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>Joshua Burke</p>
        <p>I am studying Software Enginnering with an embedded systems certificate</p>
        <p>this will be my first semester where i am working full time and going to school part-time so i am kind of scared about the workload</p>
        <p>I got married this january and i am already expecting a boy to be the start of my litle family</p>
        <p>I am really excited to start this class because i have done other types of programming but this one seems really fun</p>
        <p>I also think that knowing how the internet and websites work is an invaulable skill and so i am really excited to get started with this class</p>
        <p>I have just started my journey to being a software designer but i am really excited, I have already seen many applications that could be created to help others that i want to one day</p>
        <h2>Question for you</h2>
        <p>if you could go back in time and watch one moment in history what would you watch?</p>
        <p>I would love to hear the discussion and the arguments that were had as the decloration of independence was written. =]</p>
